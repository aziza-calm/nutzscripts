some useful scripts

`xlrebase.ipynb` - jupyter notebook script which rebases the excel file and saves the results to `result.xlsx`

`rexl.py` - the same but in pure python

Requirements: openpyxl, pymorphy2 modules and two excel files, one with data (`from.xlsx`) and one with only base (`to.xlsx`)
